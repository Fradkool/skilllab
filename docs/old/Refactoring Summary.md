# SkillLab Refactoring Summary

## Completed Components

1. **Centralized Schema Definitions**
   - Created `schemas/` directory with JSON schemas for data models
   - Implemented validation utilities in `schemas/validation.py`

2. **Standardized Configuration**
   - Created `config/` module with YAML-based configuration
   - Implemented validation with Pydantic in `config/schema.py` 
   - Added support for environment variable overrides
   - Ensured backward compatibility with command-line arguments

3. **Consolidated Database Management**
   - Created `database/` module with clean, reusable abstractions
   - Implemented `DatabaseConnection` with connection pooling
   - Added `BaseRepository` pattern for data access
   - Consolidated metrics collection into `MetricsRepository`

4. **Pipeline Architecture**
   - Created `pipeline/` module with composable pipeline steps
   - Implemented `PipelineStep` interface for consistent behavior
   - Added `PipelineContext` for passing data between steps
   - Created `PipelineExecutor` for running complete pipelines
   - Implemented sample step (OCRExtractionStep)

5. **API Layer**
   - Created `api/` module with high-level functions
   - Implemented extraction API functions
   - Separated business logic from CLI interface

6. **Testing Structure**
   - Set up pytest testing framework
   - Added fixtures for testing in `tests/conftest.py`
   - Created sample unit test for API functions

7. **Main Application**
   - Updated `main.py` to use the new architecture
   - Maintained backward compatibility with CLI arguments
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Architecture Highlights

### Dependency Flow
- UI/CLI Layer → API Layer → Pipeline → Repositories → Database
- Configuration and schemas accessible at all levels

### Decoupling
- Business logic is now separated from UI code
- Repositories handle data access independent of data processing
- Pipeline steps are composable and independent

### Maintainability Improvements
- Consistent interfaces and patterns throughout the codebase
- Better error handling and logging
- Configuration and schemas are centralized
- Testing framework in place

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Pipeline Steps**
   - Implement remaining pipeline steps (JSON generation, correction, etc.)

2. **UI Separation**
   - Create `ui/` module with CLI and web interfaces

3. **Database Migration**
   - Implement Alembic migrations for schema versioning

4. **Add More Tests**
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for the complete pipeline

5. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings throughout the codebase
   - Create user and developer documentation
