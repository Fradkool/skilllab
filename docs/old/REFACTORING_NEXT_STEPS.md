# SkillLab Refactoring: Next Steps

Based on the current refactoring progress, this document outlines the next steps to continue migrating the codebase to the new architecture.

## Completed Steps

- [x] **Database Management (100% Complete)**
  - [x] Created `database/` directory
  - [x] Implemented `database/core.py` with repository pattern
  - [x] Migrated metrics database to `database/metrics_db.py`
  - [x] Migrated review database to `database/review_db.py`
  - [x] Implemented `database/sync.py` for synchronization
  - [x] Updated API to use new database components
  - [x] Added proper issue format handling and compatibility

- [x] **Configuration Standardization (100%)**
  - [x] Created `config/` directory
  - [x] Implemented YAML-based configuration
  - [x] Added validation through `config/schema.py`
  - [x] Migrated all hardcoded values to configuration
  - [x] Updated all code to use central configuration system

- [x] **Pipeline Architecture (100%)**
  - [x] Created `pipeline/` directory with core components
  - [x] Implemented abstract interface for pipeline steps
  - [x] Added context object for data passing
  - [x] Created pipeline executor for orchestration
  - [x] Converted extraction to use step-based pattern
  - [x] Updated main.py to use new pipeline architecture

- [x] **API Layer (100%)**
  - [x] Created `api/` directory
  - [x] Implemented extraction API with proper error handling
  - [x] Implemented review API with connection to new database
  - [x] Implemented health check API
  - [x] Implemented training API with model management
  - [x] Implemented monitoring API with metrics repository integration
  - [x] Updated CLI to fully use API

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Monitoring (Priority: High)**
   - Implement real-time metrics dashboard
   - Add email/Slack notifications for critical events
   - Create periodic health check reports
   - Develop system resource usage alerts

2. **Production Readiness (Priority: Medium)**
   - Add CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Add system monitoring and alerts
   - Implement logging standardization throughout the application

3. **UI Component Separation (Priority: Low - Complete)**
   - ✅ Created UI layer in `ui/` directory 
   - ✅ Extracted dashboard UI components from `monitor/dashboard.py`
   - ✅ Created abstraction for CLI vs Web interfaces
   - ✅ Implemented adapter pattern for connecting APIs to UI components
   - ✅ Updated training interface to use the new UI components

4. **Testing Expansion (Priority: Medium)**
   - ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests for UI components
   - ✅ Added integration tests for UI adapters and factory
   - ✅ Added tests for database components and synchronization
   - ✅ Added tests for API layer functionality (extraction, review, training, monitoring)
   - Create fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Add integration tests for full workflows
   - Implement automated performance testing

5. **Docker Containerization (Priority: High - Complete)**
   - ✅ Containerized Ollama for LLM inference
   - ✅ Containerized PaddleOCR for document OCR
   - ✅ Created Docker Compose setup for running both services
   - ✅ Updated OCR extractor to use the PaddleOCR service
   - ✅ Implemented health checks for containerized services
   - ✅ Updated JSON generator to better integrate with Ollama service
   - ✅ Added automatic retries and robust error handling for containerized services
   - ✅ Created comprehensive deployment documentation for containerized setup
   - ✅ Added health check API and utility to the main application

## Code Migration Plan

### Phase 1: CLI Refactoring

1. Update CLI commands to use the API layer:
   - Replace direct database calls with API calls
   - Use consistent error handling patterns
   - Add proper help text and documentation

2. Test all CLI commands to ensure they work correctly with the new API

3. Add tests for CLI commands in `tests/unit/test_cli/`

### Phase 2: UI Component Separation (COMPLETED)

1. ✅ Created base UI components in `ui/` directory
2. ✅ Extracted dashboard rendering logic from `monitor/dashboard.py`
3. ✅ Created shared UI components for CLI and web interfaces
4. ✅ Implemented adapter pattern for connecting APIs to UI components
5. ✅ Updated monitoring dashboard to use new UI components
6. ✅ Updated review app to use new UI components
7. ✅ Updated training interface to use new UI components
8. ✅ Added unit tests for UI components
9. ✅ Added integration tests for UI adapters and factory

## Deprecation Plan

Once all components are migrated to the new architecture:

1. Add deprecation warnings to old code
2. Update documentation to recommend new APIs
3. Create migration guide for users

## Final Steps

1. Update all documentation to reflect new architecture
2. Create comprehensive test suite
3. Add CI/CD configuration

## Implementation Timeline

- UI Component Separation: 2-3 days (COMPLETED)
- Docker Containerization: 2-3 days (COMPLETED)
- Database Refactoring: 1-2 days (COMPLETED)
- API Layer Development: 2-3 days (COMPLETED)
- CLI Refactoring: 1-2 days (COMPLETED)
- Testing and Documentation: 1-2 days (80% Complete)

Total estimated time: 7-12 days (all major milestones completed: Database, UI Components, API Layer, CLI Modernization, Docker containerization)
