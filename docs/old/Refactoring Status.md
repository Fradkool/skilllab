# SkillLab Refactoring Status

## Overview

This document provides a status update on the ongoing refactoring of the SkillLab project based on the plan outlined in `REFACTORING.md`. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Current Progress

| Refactoring Goal | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Database Management | **Partially Completed** | 50% | Core database structure created, migration in progress |
| Configuration Standardization | **Completed** | 100% | YAML-based configuration system fully implemented |
| UI Component Separation | **Not Started** | 0% | Empty `ui/` directory exists but no implementation |
| Pipeline Architecture | **Completed** | 100% | Step-based pipeline with executor implemented |
| Testing Structure | **In Progress** | 30% | Basic structure created, limited test coverage |
| Schema Definitions | **Completed** | 100% | JSON schemas for data models implemented |
| API Layer | **Partially Completed** | 40% | Initial extraction API implemented |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Database Management (50%)

**Completed:**
- Created `database/` directory
- Implemented `database/core.py` with base functionality
- Implemented `database/metrics_db.py`

**Pending:**
- Implementation of `database/review_db.py` 
- Migration of functionality from `review/db_manager.py`
- Migration of `utils/db_sync.py` to `database/sync.py`
- Adding deprecation warnings to old code

**Current State:**
The system currently operates with a mix of old and new database code. The metrics database has been migrated to the new structure, but the review database still uses the old implementation. Database synchronization is still handled by `utils/db_sync.py`.

### 2. Configuration Standardization (100%)

**Completed:**
- Created `config/` directory
- Implemented `config/default.yaml` with all configuration parameters
- Implemented `config/loader.py` for configuration management
- Implemented `config/schema.py` for validation
- Updated `main.py` to use new configuration system
- Ensured backward compatibility for command-line arguments

**Current State:**
The configuration system is fully implemented and in use. The system supports both YAML files and environment variables, with proper validation and default values.

### 3. UI Component Separation (0%)

**Completed:**
- Created empty `ui/` directory

**Pending:**
- Separation of CLI dashboard from `monitor/dashboard.py`
- Separation of web dashboard from `review/app.py`
- Creation of common UI components
- Update of launcher scripts

**Current State:**
UI component separation has not been started. The `ui/` directory exists but is empty. Both dashboards still mix UI code with business logic.

### 4. Pipeline Architecture (100%)

**Completed:**
- Created `pipeline/` directory
- Implemented `pipeline/base.py` with step interface
- Implemented `pipeline/executor.py` for pipeline execution
- Added `pipeline/steps/ocr_step.py` as first step implementation
- Updated `main.py` to use new pipeline architecture

**Current State:**
The pipeline architecture is fully implemented and in use. The system uses a step-based approach with consistent interfaces between steps and proper error handling.

### 5. Testing Structure (30%)

**Completed:**
- Created `tests/` directory
- Implemented `tests/conftest.py`
- Added initial unit tests for API

**Pending:**
- Expansion of unit test coverage
- Addition of integration tests
- Creation of test fixtures for sample data
- Setup of CI configuration

**Current State:**
The testing structure has been started but has limited coverage. Only basic unit tests for the API layer have been implemented.

### 6. Schema Definitions (100%)

**Completed:**
- Created `schemas/` directory
- Implemented `schemas/resume.json`
- Implemented `schemas/metrics.json`
- Implemented `schemas/validation.py`
- Updated code to use centralized schemas

**Current State:**
Schema definitions have been fully centralized and are in use throughout the codebase for validation.

### 7. API Layer (40%)

**Completed:**
- Created `api/` directory
- Implemented `api/extraction.py` for OCR operations

**Pending:**
- Implementation of `api/training.py`
- Implementation of `api/review.py`
- Implementation of `api/monitoring.py`
- Full migration of CLI to use API

**Current State:**
The API layer has been started but is incomplete. Only the extraction API has been implemented, and the CLI still contains substantial business logic.

## Next Steps

Based on the current progress, the recommended next steps are:

1. **Complete Database Management**
   - Implement `database/review_db.py`
   - Migrate functionality from `review/db_manager.py`
   - Move `utils/db_sync.py` to `database/sync.py`

2. **Continue API Layer Development**
   - Implement remaining API modules
   - Update CLI to use API

3. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for newly refactored components
   - Start implementing integration tests

4. **Begin UI Component Separation**
   - Start with separation of CLI dashboard
   - Then move to web dashboard

## Compatibility Notes

The current codebase is in a transitional state with a mix of old and new architecture. The following points should be considered when working with the code:

- **Main Pipeline:** Uses the new pipeline architecture but may still reference old database code
- **Database Access:** Metrics uses new implementation, review still uses old
- **Configuration:** Fully migrated to new system
- **API vs CLI:** Some functionality available through API, some still in CLI

When extending the codebase, prefer using the new architecture patterns where available, while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

## Conclusion

The refactoring is progressing well, with 3 of 7 goals fully completed and 2 more partially implemented. The most critical components (configuration and pipeline architecture) have been successfully migrated, providing a solid foundation for the remaining work.

The current mixed state of old and new architecture requires careful consideration during development, but the path forward is clear and well-defined.
